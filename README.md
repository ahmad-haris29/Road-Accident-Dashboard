# Road Accident Dashboard

🚗 Road Accident Dashboard :

This project analyzes road accident data to uncover key insights and provide actionable recommendations for improving road safety. The analysis was conducted entirely using Excel with the help of Power Query and Power Pivot.

📌 Project Overview :

• In this project, I extracted, transformed, and visualized road accident data using Excel to identify trends, high-risk areas, and patterns related to accident severity. The dashboard serves as a tool to aid decision-making for policymakers and road safety authorities by highlighting key metrics and trends.

🛠 Technologies Used :

• Excel: To preprocess, analyze, and validate the data using built-in tools like Power Query and Power Pivot.

🎯 Objectives :

• Analyze road accident data to understand trends across different timeframes and conditions.

• Identify high-risk factors like vehicle types, road types, and weather conditions.

• Provide a clear summary of key performance indicators (KPIs) to drive decision-making.

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) :

• Total Casualties: 23,248

• Fatal: 417 (1.8%)

• Serious: 2,294 (9.9%)

• Slight: 20,537 (88.3%)

• Casualties by Cars: 17,696 (76.1% of total)

• Casualties by Rural vs. Urban Areas:

Rural: 8,200

Urban: 15,100

🔍 Key Insights :

• Accident Trends

Accident frequency peaks during certain months, as shown in the monthly trend analysis.
Urban areas account for the majority of casualties, with significantly higher numbers than rural areas.

• High-Risk Factors

Road Type:Single carriageways are the most accident-prone, with 18.9K casualties.

Road Surface: Dry roads see the highest number of accidents, but wet conditions also contribute significantly.

 Light Conditions: Most accidents occur in darkness (16.3K casualties).

💡 Recommendations :

• Infrastructure Improvements: Focus on enhancing safety measures on single carriageways and urban areas.

• Awareness Campaigns: Educate drivers about the dangers of driving in poor weather or at night.

• Traffic Monitoring: Deploy additional surveillance and monitoring in accident-prone areas to reduce risks.
